# Project Instructions

## Overview

This repo contains the MCP fuzzer, docs, schemas, and tests. Use the
instructions below when making changes.

## Docs

- Docs live in `docs/`. Update them when code changes affect user-facing behavior.
- Keep documentation accurate and aligned with the current code and CLI behavior.
- Prefer updating existing docs over adding new ones unless necessary.

## Testing

- Run the smallest relevant tests when changing behavior.
- If you cannot run tests, note what should be run.
