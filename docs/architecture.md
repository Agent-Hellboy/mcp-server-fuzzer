# Architecture

This document describes the architecture and design of the MCP Server Fuzzer system.

## System Overview

The MCP Server Fuzzer is built with a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and provides clear interfaces between components. The system is designed to be:

- **Protocol Agnostic**: Fuzzer logic is independent of transport protocols
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new transport protocols and fuzzing strategies
- **Safe**: Built-in safety mechanisms protect against dangerous operations
- **Testable**: Each component can be tested independently

## Component Details

### 1. CLI Layer

The CLI layer provides the user interface and handles argument parsing, validation, and execution flow.

**Key Components:**

- `args.py`: Defines and validates command-line arguments
- `main.py`: Main entry point that orchestrates the CLI
- `runner.py`: Executes the fuzzing logic based on parsed arguments

**Responsibilities:**

- Parse and validate user input
- Create appropriate transport instances
- Initialize the fuzzing client
- Handle errors and display results

### 2. Transport Layer

The transport layer abstracts communication with MCP servers, supporting multiple protocols.

**Key Components:**

- `base.py`: Abstract TransportProtocol class defining the interface
- `factory.py`: Factory function for creating transport instances
- `http.py`: HTTP/HTTPS transport implementation
- `sse.py`: Server-Sent Events transport implementation
- `stdio.py`: Standard I/O transport for local processes

**Transport Protocol Interface:**

```python
class TransportProtocol(ABC):
    async def send_request(self, method: str, params=None) -> Any
    async def send_raw(self, payload: Any) -> Any
    async def send_notification(self, method: str, params=None) -> None
    async def get_tools(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
    async def call_tool(self, name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any
```

### 3. Fuzzing Engine

The fuzzing engine orchestrates the testing process and manages test execution.

**Key Components:**

- `tool_fuzzer.py`: Tests individual tools with various argument combinations
- `protocol_fuzzer.py`: Tests MCP protocol types with various message structures
- `invariants.py`: Implements property-based invariants and checks for fuzz testing
- `executor.py`: Provides asynchronous execution framework with concurrency control and retry mechanisms

**Fuzzing Process:**

1. **Discovery**: Automatically discover available tools from the server
2. **Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate fuzzing strategy (realistic vs aggressive)
3. **Data Generation**: Generate test data using Hypothesis and custom strategies
4. **Execution**: Execute tests with controlled concurrency via AsyncFuzzExecutor
5. **Invariant Verification**: Verify responses against property-based invariants
6. **Analysis**: Analyze results and generate reports

### 4. Runtime Management System

The runtime management system provides robust, asynchronous subprocess lifecycle management for transports and target servers under test.

**Key Components:**

- `manager.py`: Fully async ProcessManager for start/stop processes, send signals, await exit, collect stats
- `watchdog.py`: ProcessWatchdog for monitoring registered PIDs for hangs/inactivity and terminating them based on policy
- `executor.py`: AsyncFuzzExecutor providing concurrency control, error handling, and result aggregation

**Runtime Features:**

- **Fully Async API**: All operations use native asyncio; blocking calls run in thread executors
- **Process-Group Signaling**: On POSIX systems, uses process-group signaling to prevent orphan children
- **Safe Stop Flow**: TERM (grace window) â†’ KILL on timeout if needed
- **Watchdog Auto-Management**: Auto-starts on first registration/start; auto-unregisters on stop
- **Activity Monitoring**: Supports activity callbacks for hang detection
- **Concurrency Control**: Bounded concurrency with semaphore-based limiting
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Configurable retry with exponential backoff
- **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple operations concurrently with result collection

### 5. Strategy System

The strategy system generates test data using different approaches.

**Key Components:**

- `realistic/`: Generates valid, realistic data for functionality testing
- `aggressive/`: Generates malicious/malformed data for security testing
- `strategy_manager.py`: Orchestrates strategy selection and execution
- `schema_parser.py`: Parses JSON Schema definitions to generate appropriate test data

**Strategy Types:**

- **Realistic Strategies**: Generate valid Base64, UUIDs, timestamps, semantic versions
- **Aggressive Strategies**: Generate SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, buffer overflow attempts

**Schema Parser:**

The schema parser provides comprehensive support for parsing JSON Schema definitions and generating appropriate test data based on schema specifications. It handles:

- Basic types: string, number, integer, boolean, array, object, null
- String constraints: minLength, maxLength, pattern, format
- Number/Integer constraints: minimum, maximum, exclusiveMinimum, exclusiveMaximum, multipleOf
- Array constraints: minItems, maxItems, uniqueItems
- Object constraints: required properties, minProperties, maxProperties
- Schema combinations: oneOf, anyOf, allOf
- Enums and constants

The module supports both "realistic" and "aggressive" fuzzing strategies, where realistic mode generates valid data conforming to the schema, while aggressive mode intentionally generates edge cases and invalid data to test error handling.

### 5. Invariants System

The invariants system provides property-based testing capabilities to verify response validity, error type correctness, and prevention of unintended crashes or unexpected states during fuzzing.

**Key Components:**

- `check_response_validity`: Ensures responses follow JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
- `check_error_type_correctness`: Verifies error responses have correct structure and codes
- `check_response_schema_conformity`: Validates responses against JSON schema definitions
- `verify_response_invariants`: Orchestrates multiple invariant checks on a single response
- `verify_batch_responses`: Applies invariant checks to batches of responses
- `check_state_consistency`: Ensures server state remains consistent during fuzzing

These invariants serve as runtime assertions that validate the behavior of the server being tested, helping to identify potential issues that might not be caught by simple error checking.

### 6. Safety System

The safety system provides multiple layers of protection against dangerous operations.

**Key Components:**

- `safety.py`: Core safety logic and filtering
- `system_blocker.py`: System command blocking and PATH shimming

**Safety Features:**

- **SafetyFilter**: Centralized filter for all tool and protocol calls
- **System Command Blocking**: Prevents execution of dangerous commands (PATH shims)
- **Filesystem Sandboxing**: Confines file operations to specified directories
- **Process Isolation**: Safe subprocess handling with timeouts
- **Input Sanitization**: Filters potentially dangerous input

### 7. Authentication System

The authentication system manages various authentication methods for MCP servers.

**Key Components:**

- `providers.py`: Authentication provider implementations
- `manager.py`: Authentication management and coordination
- `loaders.py`: Configuration loading from files and environment

**Supported Auth Types:**

- **API Key authentication**
- **Basic username/password authentication**
- **OAuth token authentication**
- **Custom header authentication**

### 8. Reporting System

The reporting system provides centralized output management and comprehensive result reporting.

**Key Components:**

- `reporter.py`: Main `FuzzerReporter` class that coordinates all reporting
- `formatters.py`: Output formatters for different formats (Console, JSON, Text)
- `safety_reporter.py`: Dedicated safety system reporting and statistics

**Reporting Features:**

- **Safety Reports**: Detailed safety system data and blocked operations
- **Session Reports**: Metadata, configuration, and execution statistics

## Runtime Management Details

### ProcessManager

The `ProcessManager` provides fully asynchronous subprocess lifecycle management with the following capabilities:

**Core Features:**
- **Async Process Creation**: Uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` for non-blocking process spawning
- **Process Registration**: Automatically registers processes with the watchdog for monitoring
- **Signal Handling**: Supports graceful termination (SIGTERM) and force kill (SIGKILL) with process-group signaling
- **Status Tracking**: Maintains comprehensive process state including start time, status, and configuration
- **Cleanup Management**: Automatic cleanup of finished processes to prevent resource leaks

**Process Lifecycle:**
1. **Start**: Process is created with asyncio, registered with watchdog, and tracked in manager
2. **Monitor**: Watchdog monitors for hangs and inactivity using activity callbacks
3. **Stop**: Graceful termination with escalation to force kill if needed
4. **Cleanup**: Process is unregistered from watchdog and removed from tracking

**Configuration Options:**
- `command`: List of command and arguments
- `cwd`: Working directory for the process
- `env`: Environment variables (merged with current environment)
- `timeout`: Default timeout for process operations
- `auto_kill`: Whether to automatically kill hanging processes
- `name`: Human-readable name for logging and identification
- `activity_callback`: Optional callback to report process activity

### ProcessWatchdog

The `ProcessWatchdog` provides automated monitoring and termination of hanging processes:

**Monitoring Features:**
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitors process activity through callbacks or timestamps
- **Hang Detection**: Identifies processes that haven't been active for configured timeout periods
- **Automatic Termination**: Can automatically kill hanging processes based on policy
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Separate thresholds for warning, timeout, and force kill

**Configuration Options:**
- `check_interval`: How often to check processes (default: 1.0 seconds)
- `process_timeout`: Time before process is considered hanging (default: 30.0 seconds)
- `extra_buffer`: Extra time before auto-kill (default: 5.0 seconds)
- `max_hang_time`: Maximum time before force kill (default: 60.0 seconds)
- `auto_kill`: Whether to automatically kill hanging processes (default: true)

**Activity Callbacks:**
Processes can register activity callbacks that return timestamps indicating when they were last active. This allows for more sophisticated hang detection based on actual process activity rather than just time elapsed.

### AsyncFuzzExecutor

The `AsyncFuzzExecutor` provides controlled concurrency and robust error handling for fuzzing operations:

**Concurrency Control:**
- **Bounded Concurrency**: Uses semaphore to limit concurrent operations
- **Task Tracking**: Maintains set of running tasks for proper shutdown
- **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple operations concurrently with result collection

**Error Handling:**
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for individual operations
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed operations
- **Exception Collection**: Collects and categorizes errors from batch operations

**Configuration Options:**
- `max_concurrency`: Maximum number of concurrent operations (default: 5)
- `timeout`: Default timeout for operations (default: 30.0 seconds)
- `retry_count`: Number of retries for failed operations (default: 1)
- `retry_delay`: Delay between retries (default: 1.0 seconds)

**Usage Patterns:**
- **Single Operations**: Execute individual operations with timeout and error handling
- **Retry Operations**: Execute operations with automatic retry on failure
- **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple operations concurrently with bounded concurrency

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **Transport Layer**: Handles communication protocols
- **Fuzzing Engine**: Manages test execution
- **Strategy System**: Generates test data
- **Safety System**: Provides protection mechanisms
- **AsyncFuzzExecutor**: Manages concurrency and execution

### 2. Protocol Agnosticism

The fuzzer logic is completely independent of transport protocols:

- **Fuzzing strategies work** with any transport
- **New transports can be added** without changing fuzzer logic
- **Transport-specific details** are encapsulated

### 3. Extensibility

The system is designed for extensibility:

- **New transport protocols** can be added by implementing the interface
- **New fuzzing strategies** can be added to the strategy system
- **New safety features** can be added to the safety system

### 4. Safety First

Safety is built into every layer:

- **Environment detection** prevents dangerous operations
- **Input sanitization** filters potentially dangerous data
- **System command blocking** prevents command execution
- **Filesystem sandboxing** confines file operations

### 5. Testability

Each component can be tested independently:

- **Clear interfaces** between components
- **Dependency injection** for external dependencies
- **Comprehensive mocking** support
- **Isolated test environments**

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

The system uses environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# Core configuration
export MCP_FUZZER_TIMEOUT=30.0
export MCP_FUZZER_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
export MCP_FUZZER_SAFETY_ENABLED=true

# Transport configuration
export MCP_FUZZER_HTTP_TIMEOUT=30.0
export MCP_FUZZER_SSE_TIMEOUT=30.0
export MCP_FUZZER_STDIO_TIMEOUT=30.0

# Safety configuration
export MCP_FUZZER_FS_ROOT=~/.mcp_fuzzer
export MCP_FUZZER_ENABLE_SAFETY=true
export MCP_FUZZER_DANGEROUS_TESTS_DISABLED=false
```

## Performance Considerations
