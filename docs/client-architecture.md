# Client Architecture

The MCP Fuzzer client has been refactored into a modular package structure to improve maintainability, testability, and extensibility. This document describes the new architecture.

## Overview

The client package is organized into several modules, each with a specific responsibility:

```
mcp_fuzzer/
├── client/
│   ├── __init__.py              # Exports main client class
│   ├── base.py                  # Base client class with common functionality
│   ├── tool_client.py           # Tool fuzzing functionality
│   ├── protocol_client.py       # Protocol fuzzing functionality
│   └── utils.py                 # Utility functions
└── client.py                    # Backward compatibility
```

## Components

### Base Client (`base.py`)

The `MCPFuzzerClient` class in `base.py` is the main entry point for fuzzing operations. It:

- Integrates the tool and protocol clients
- Manages shared resources like transport and authentication
- Provides high-level fuzzing methods
- Delegates specific functionality to specialized clients
- Handles reporting and cleanup

### Tool Client (`tool_client.py`)

The `ToolClient` class in `tool_client.py` handles all tool-related fuzzing operations:

- Fuzzing individual tools
- Fuzzing all tools from a server
- Two-phase fuzzing (realistic and aggressive)
- Safety checks for tool arguments

### Protocol Client (`protocol_client.py`)

The `ProtocolClient` class in `protocol_client.py` handles all protocol-related fuzzing operations:

- Fuzzing specific protocol types
- Fuzzing all protocol types
- Safety checks for protocol messages
- Sending different types of protocol requests

### Utilities (`utils.py`)

The `utils.py` module provides common utility functions used across the client package:

- Getting tool names with fallbacks
- Creating standardized error results
- Calculating success rates
- Running operations with timeouts

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Smaller, more manageable classes and methods
3. **Improved Testability**: Easier to write targeted unit tests
4. **Better Extensibility**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: Dependencies between components are explicit

## Usage

The new client can be used in the same way as the old client:

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.client import MCPFuzzerClient
from mcp_fuzzer.transport.factory import create_transport

async def fuzz_server():
    transport = create_transport('http', 'http://localhost:8000')
    client = MCPFuzzerClient(transport)
    results = await client.fuzz_all_tools(runs_per_tool=5)
    print(f"Fuzzing results: {results}")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(fuzz_server())
```

For backward compatibility, the old `UnifiedMCPFuzzerClient` name is still available as an alias for `MCPFuzzerClient`.

## Future Improvements

1. **Plugin Architecture**: Add support for custom fuzzing strategies via plugins
2. **Additional Output Formats**: Implement support for JSON, XML, and CSV output formats
3. **Configuration Integration**: Better integration with the configuration system
4. **Metrics Collection**: Add detailed metrics collection for performance monitoring
5. **Async Context Manager**: Implement `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` for use in async with statements
