# MCP Server Fuzz Results

Hey, here's what we found when we fuzzed the DesktopCommanderMCP server. We tested 23 tools with 115 runs and got some interesting results.

## Quick Summary

- **Total Tools:** 23
- **Total Runs:** 115
- **Success Rate:** 96.5%
- **Issues Found:** 4 exceptions, 2 vulnerabilities

## What We Tested

**DesktopCommanderMCP Server**
- From: [https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP)
- Version: 0.2.11
- It's a Node.js server for terminal and file operations

## How We Did It

We used the MCP Fuzzer with safety systems enabled. Ran multiple phases:
- Basic fuzzing (simple inputs)
- Realistic fuzzing (real-world scenarios)
- Aggressive fuzzing (edge cases and weird inputs)

All tests used `--output-dir /tmp` to keep things clean.

## Results

## What We Found

### Good Stuff
1. **File operations are solid** - All file system tools worked perfectly (100% success)
2. **Search tools are great** - No issues with any search functionality
3. **Safety system works** - Prevented dangerous operations effectively
4. **Most tools are reliable** - 21 out of 23 tools had perfect scores

### Issues We Found
1. **Process connection problems** - `start_process` failed 60% of the time due to connection issues
2. **Output reading glitches** - `read_process_output` had some issues with reading process output

## What To Do About It

- **Fix connection handling** in process management tools
- **Add retry logic** for failed connections
- **Improve error messages** when processes fail to start
- **Test more** with different network conditions

## Test Setup

- **OS:** macOS Sequoia
- **Node.js:** v18+
- **MCP Fuzzer:** Latest version
- **Safety:** Enabled with command blocking

## How To Run These Tests

### Get Set Up
```bash
# Clone the server
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP.git
cd DesktopCommanderMCP

# Install stuff
npm install
npm run build

# Install the fuzzer
pip install mcp-fuzzer
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Basic test
mcp-fuzzer --mode tools --protocol stdio --endpoint "node DesktopCommanderMCP/dist/index.js" --runs 5 --verbose --enable-safety-system --output-dir /tmp

# More thorough test
mcp-fuzzer --mode tools --protocol stdio --endpoint "node DesktopCommanderMCP/dist/index.js" --runs 10 --phase realistic --enable-safety-system --output-dir /tmp

# Aggressive testing
mcp-fuzzer --mode tools --protocol stdio --endpoint "node DesktopCommanderMCP/dist/index.js" --runs 10 --phase aggressive --enable-safety-system --output-dir /tmp
```

**Note:** Use `--output-dir /tmp` to avoid cluttering your workspace. Some output might still go to "reports" folder, so you might need to clean that up: `rm -rf reports/`

## Bottom Line

The server is pretty solid overall. File operations work great, safety systems are effective, but process management needs some work on connection reliability. Nothing critical, but worth fixing for better user experience.
